# the_kirchhoff_bot

This repository includes the code of a bot for Telegram groups management. It is developed having in mind a very specific use case: Telegram groups focused on *basic ciruit theory* (maybe now you understand why it is named `the_kirchhoff_bot`).

As I said before, the bot is developed having in mind the use case of the authors. Therefore, some tools are not very user friendly, but they are effective as the possibility to send scheduled poll in the group.

The code is documented to the best of my possibilities, therefore, I'll not spend any other work here. As someone said me in the past "the code is obvious". Even if I do not completely believe to this statement, you can have a look at the code and let me know if you need information.
